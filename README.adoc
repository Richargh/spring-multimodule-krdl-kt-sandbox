= Spring Multibuild Sandbox

== Wrapper

Please make sure you have the newest Gradle (>v6) version installed if you run the `gradle wrapper` task.

== Gradle Kotlin Dsl

This project uses the gradle kotlin dsl. We'll just shorten that to kradle though.

* You can find lots of official link:https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl-samples/tree/master/samples[Gradle Kotlin Dsl Samples] online
* The official docs provide a link:https://guides.gradle.org/migrating-build-logic-from-groovy-to-kotlin/[Migration Guide] from Groovy to Kotlin
* There is also the link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html[Gradle Kotlin DSL User Guide] to consider.
